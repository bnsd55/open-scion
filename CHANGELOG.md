# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project will follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) from its first
release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `scion-core`: the object model (changesets, trees, blob IDs) and a frozen,
  canonical v1 byte format, with golden tests, property tests and a fuzz
  target.
- `scion-server`: SQLite metadata and trees, a blob folder with batched,
  verified durability, and one write path for changesets and their root
  trees.
- Group commit: concurrent blob syncs and database commits share one full
  drive flush.
- One-way git import. Imported commits are checked against git, and a
  re-import never moves a ref off later lands.
- Server-side commits (`CreateChangeset`) and lands: path-level conflict
  checks through a per-ref index, one transaction per land, retries by
  request key, and bounded retry when the ref moves.
- Reads over the API: resolve a ref, read a file, list a directory, history.
- `scn`, the command-line client: `cat`, `ls`, `log`, `show`, `commit`,
  `land` and `bench`, with `--json` output.
- `scn checkout`, into a new directory or an existing empty one. An
  existing directory is kept, with its mode and owner, and its parent need
  not be writable. It must not be writable by all users unless it has the
  sticky bit. Writes go through directory handles and never follow a
  symlink, and each directory is opened about once. On failure or Ctrl-C,
  what was written is removed.
- Path history and blame on first-parent history: `Log` takes an optional
  path and says where to continue, and a new `Blame` RPC gives each line's
  last changeset. `scn log --path` and `scn blame`. Each call has a bound,
  and the client continues where a call stopped. An older server ignores
  the new `path` field, so `scn log --path` against it prints unfiltered
  history.
- Bearer-token auth, loopback-only listening by default, request limits and
  name validation at the RPC boundary.
- `ReadFile` streams a file in 1 MiB parts from the zstd decoder, under a
  256 MiB budget for all replies. It checks the content against its ID
  before the last part, and ends a stalled reply with `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`.
- The path index of each ref stays within a budget of 128 MiB. When it is
  full, it starts over at the tip, and the lands still get the same answers.
- A land walks at most 100,000 changesets below the path index. A base
  further back is `REJECTED` as too old, and the client must rebase.
- A land checks the request deadline in its long loops, because a timeout
  does not stop a running job. Past it, the land fails with
  `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` and stays pending.
- `scion-tier`: the cache tiers. `scion-cache` keeps objects in memory and
  `scion-daemon` keeps them on disk, each under a byte limit, least recently
  used out first. The daemon listens on a Unix socket with mode 0600. Each
  tier answers the `Objects` calls, checks every object from upstream
  against its ID before it stores or sends it, forwards `ResolveRef`, keeps
  `GetRootTree` answers, fetches a shared miss once, and needs a token.
- `scn` reaches a daemon with `--server unix:///PATH`. It first refuses a
  path that is not a socket owned by its user or by root.
- A `GetObjects` reply never ends `OK` with no object. If the server or a
  tier has no memory for the first object within 120 s, the call fails
  with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`.
- `docs/protocol-v1.md`: the contract of the `Scion` and `Objects` services,
  for independent clients, tiers and servers.
- Query API: `MergeBase` (every best common ancestor, as
  `git merge-base --all`), `IsAncestor`, and `Diff` (the paths whose file
  differs between two changesets, optionally below a path). The graph walks
  use generation numbers and stop at 10,000 changesets with
  `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`. A `Diff` reply holds at most 1,000 paths and says
  where to continue. `scn merge-base`, `scn is-ancestor` (exit 0 or 1) and
  `scn diff`. Every `scn` error now exits 2, so it never reads as the "no"
  of `scn is-ancestor`.
- Derived data is derived in bounded steps, one transaction each, so other
  requests run between steps after a new kind or a version bump. Each step
  removes some rows of older versions. `scion-server derive --kind
  root_tree` fills a ref's history ahead of reads and removes the rest.
